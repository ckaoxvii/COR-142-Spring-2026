The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive overview of the statistical literacy required to cope with the practical demands of daily life in a way that encourages responsible citizenship in modern democracy. Course objectives will emphasize critical thinking and problem solving, with the application of statistical skills to real-world scenarios requiring reasoning from evidence. Overall, this course is an introduction to the fundamental concepts and methods of statistics. Topics include data organization; graphs and numerical measures; probability; normal, and sampling distributions; confidence intervals and hypothesis testing; correlation; and regression."

Modern democracy requires citizens to be adept at applying quantitative information to make sound judgements and inferences that promote thoughtful stewardship."

Every missing set of completed notes, even when absent, will result in a 5% drop to this category.\nQuizzes – Four online quizzes in Canvas\nUnit Exams – Four 50-minute in-class unit exams\nFinal Exam – A 2-hour comprehensive final exam will be given .\nFinal Project – A group project will be completed during the last unit of study. Students will be given data to analyze through descriptive and influential statistical methods. We will work on different portions of the project throughout the semester."

    "text": "Attendance Policy\nIt is essential in the pursuit of academic excellence in all Mathematics and Technology courses that students attend class regularly. Students are, therefore, expected to attend class as part of their personal responsibility toward this pursuit of excellence. Missing more than 20% of class time (8 classes) may result in your instructor withdrawing you from class with either a “W” or “WF,” depending upon the timing published for course withdrawals by the Registrar. Please stay home if you are sick. You do not need to contact your instructor unless it happens to be on a test date.\nIf a student is absent on the date of a test, the absence must be an unavoidable excused absence (documented illness or emergency) in order for the test to be made up. If you have a documented unavoidable excused absence on the date of a test, you MUST notify the professor within 24 hours of the test session to schedule a make-up, or you will receive a zero for the test, regardless of the reason for the absence. Note that planned absences for events are not considered excused and tests must be taken in advance of any planned absences.\nIt is not permissible to leave class early or arrive tardy. You are expected to remain in the classroom throughout the duration of the class meeting. Your instructor may consider you absent for any disruptions to the class, including tardiness, early departures, and evictions from the class for disrupting others."

In statistics, we rely on skills such as analytical thinking and evidence-based decision-making that are developed through practice and improvement. As a result, you will be given opportunities to practice and grow without the use of AI. Use of Generative AI for the completion of assignments or activities will be considered academic dishonesty in the context of this course and will result in zeros on applicable assignments and/or referral to the Dean of Academic Life for further consequences."
